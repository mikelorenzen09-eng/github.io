        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>
          I am a motivated 22-year-old male with a strong passion for cars. In my spare time,
  I have also developed a long-standing interest in computers and IT, as well as for the field on currently studying, being software engineering.
  one of my favorite things to do with my spare time is working on "small" project or spending time watching other people building projects.
        </p>
        <p>
          I graduated from Rybners STX in 2023 and am currently studying at VIA University College.
